## What is Wormwood?
Wormwood is a game engine. It is being developed with C++(20) and with Vulkan as it's primary graphics API. It will have various libraries implemented to increase the development speed. Libraries used will be listed below. The goal of this project is to create something fast and leightweight for personal use as well as creating an additional pathway to learn.

## How to build
Make sure to have [Premake5](https://premake.github.io/) installed and set up properly as well as [Microsoft Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?cid=learn-navbar-download-cta). Once you have cloned the project and have Premake5 and VS installed, go to the `Scripts` folder and run the `.bat` file. This will generate `Wormwood.sln`. Open the `.sln` file and build the project. Built files will be generated in a new `Binaries` folder within the main `Wormdwood` folder.
